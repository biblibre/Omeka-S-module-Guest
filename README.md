Guest (module for Omeka S)
==========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Guest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Guest)

[Guest] is a module for [Omeka S] that creates a role called `guest`, and
provides configuration options for a login and registration screen. Guests
become registered users in Omeka S, but have no other privileges to the admin
side of your Omeka S installation. This module is thus intended to be a common
module that other modules needing a guest user use as a dependency.

This module is based on a full rewrite of the plugin [Guest User] for [Omeka Classic]
by [BibLibre].

Guest users can use Omeka via the api too (login, logout, register…) with the
module [Guest Api].


Installation
------------

If the module [GuestUser] is installed, it is recommended to upgrade it first to
version 3.3.5.1 or higher, or to disable it. See [more information to upgrade templates]
from module [GuestUser].

Uncompress files in the module directory and rename module folder `Guest`.

Then install it like any other Omeka module and follow the config instructions.

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module].


Usage
-----

### Guest login form

A guest login form is provided in `/s/my_site/guest/login`.

### Main login form

In some cases, you may want to use the same login form for all users, so you may
have to adapt it. You may use the navigation link too (in admin > sites > my-site > navigation).

```php
<?php
if ($this->identity()):
    echo $this->hyperlink($this->translate('Logout'), $this->url()->fromRoute('site/guest/guest', ['site-slug' => $site->slug(), 'action' => 'logout']), ['class' => 'logout']);
else:
    echo $this->hyperlink($this->translate('Login'), $this->url()->fromRoute('site/guest/anonymous', ['site-slug' => $site->slug(), 'action' => 'login']), ['class' => 'login']);
endif;
?>
```

### Terms agreement

A check box allows to force guests to accept terms agreement.

A button in the config forms allows to set or unset all guests acceptation,
in order to allow update of terms.


TODO
----

- Move pages to a standard page, in particular register page (see module [ContactUs]).


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [module issues] page.
